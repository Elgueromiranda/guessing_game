#**Let's Play a Guessing Game**

In this drill you will create a simple guessing game where the computer randomly chooses a number and you try to figure out what that number is.

##**Release 0: Initialize**

In the game class, start with the code for initializing the game. You can use the driver code to help guide you.

###**Note:**
For the tests you will give the option to initialize with a given parameter this is only to check certain methods. In order to code this, you should look into [default values](http://ruby-doc.com/docs/ProgrammingRuby/html/tut_methods.html) and [attr accessor](http://ruby-doc.org/core-1.9.3/Module.html#method-i-attr_accessor). They both with help in making your code pass.

##**Release 1: Get User Guess**

In the get user guess method, make it so it will get the guess of the user. Hint: in order to make the tests pass you might need to use some default values.

##**Release 2: Check Guess**

In the check guess method write the logic to check the guess and give the user feedback. **Note**: Feel free to change the output messages to whatever you like just be sure to change them in the driver code as well or the tests will return false.

##**Release 3: Play**

In the play method, make it so the game will go on until the correct number is guessed. Once this is done, comment out the driver code and have fun playing your guessing game!

##**Bonus Challange**

If you have time and want a challenge, Try to change the game to where you choose the number and the program guesses it.  While creating this logic, think about how you play the game above and try to work the program into do that. Also, be sure to create your own driver code and test that the methods are working.
